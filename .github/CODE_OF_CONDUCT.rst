Contributor Code of Conduct
===========================

Our Promise
-----------

We as members, contributors, and leaders promise to provide a harrassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, 
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, 
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, 
or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge that our interactions will contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive,
and healthy community.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable 
behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior 
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this 
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both inside the project and in public spaces where an
individual is representing the project or its associated community.  Examples of representing 
our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social 
media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by 
contacting the project team at joesmo.joesmo12@gmail.com.  All complaints will be reviewed and 
investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the 
circumstances.  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the 
reporter of an incident.  Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted 
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face 
temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
